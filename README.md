## Pseudocode for JavaScript Password Generator

User is presented with a document form that has a button.

When/If user clicks button to generate password, then user is asked which types of characters they want in the password.

User is asked for length of password that is at least 8 characters and no longer than 128 characters, else program quits.

If user inputs an integer greater than 7 and less than 129, then ask the user which types of characters to include in the password, one at a time, else quit.

If user wants to include lower case, keep track of that fact.
If user wants to include UPPER CASE, keep track of that fact.
If user wants numeric characters, keep track of that fact.
If user wants special characters, keep track of that fact.

If user has not selected at least one type of character to include in the password, then quit,

Otherwise, a password is generated.

Then, the generated password is either displayed in an alert, or is written on the screen (page).
